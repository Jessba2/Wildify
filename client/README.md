# Wildify App, Winter 2021, Fullstack: CS565
Brita Budnick and Jessica Barnett

The Wildify Application was built with React and Express. It queries the trefle plant database and the 
Open Weather Map API to lay the foundation for a gardening application. 

https://trefle.io/

https://openweathermap.org/

A gardener can choose from a variety of plant attributes and the trefle database is queried to find a 
list of plants that match those attributes. The user can also track what the weather will be like in 
their area so they can anticipate when to plant their garden.

Commits to the repository follow the Git standard: https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/3761873

## To run:

(NOTE: this is consistent with the current build which will be deployed to Heroku)
